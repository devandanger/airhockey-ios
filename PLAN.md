Of course. Here is a comprehensive design spec and task list for creating a two-player, single-screen SpriteKit air hockey game. The tasks are broken down into Manual Tasks (requiring you to use the Xcode interface or perform actions that are difficult to automate) and Claude Automated Tasks (specific code-generation prompts you can give me).
Design Spec: SpriteKit Air Hockey
1. Project Overview
A fast-paced, 2D air hockey game for iOS, built with SpriteKit. Two players compete on a single device, using their thumbs to control their respective pushers on either side of the screen. The objective is to score goals by hitting the puck into the opponent's goal. The game features a main menu, a pause/resume functionality via a three-finger tap, and realistic physics for puck movement and collisions.
2. Core Concepts & Mechanics
Game View: A top-down view of an air hockey table. The screen is divided vertically into two halves.
Player 1 (Left Side): Controls the left pusher. This pusher is confined to the left half of the screen.
Player 2 (Right Side): Controls the right pusher. This pusher is confined to the right half of the screen.
Controls: A player touches their pusher with a finger/thumb. The pusher then follows the finger's drag movement. When the finger is lifted, the pusher stops.
Physics:
The puck and pushers will have SKPhysicsBody components.
The puck will have low friction and high restitution (bounciness) to glide smoothly.
Pushers will have more mass than the puck.
The screen edges will act as indestructible walls for the puck to bounce off.
Scoring: When the puck enters a goal, the opposing player's score increases by one. The game then resets for the next round (puck returns to the center).
Game State: The game will have several states:
MainMenu: The initial screen with a "Start Game" button.
Playing: The main game loop is active.
Paused: The game simulation is frozen. A semi-transparent overlay can indicate the paused state.
GoalScored: A temporary state after a goal is scored to display the new score before resetting the puck.
3. Scene & UI Breakdown
MainMenuScene.swift:
Game Title Label (SKLabelNode).
"Start Game" Button (SKSpriteNode or SKLabelNode that responds to touches).
When "Start Game" is touched, it transitions to the GameScene.
GameScene.swift:
Background Node: Represents the air hockey table.
Edge Walls: Four SKNodes with physics bodies around the screen to contain the puck.
Pusher 1 & 2: Two SKShapeNode or SKSpriteNode objects for the player pushers.
Puck: One SKShapeNode or SKSpriteNode for the puck.
Goal 1 & 2: Two invisible SKNodes (sensors) at the left and right edges to detect goals.
Score Labels: Two SKLabelNodes to display the score for each player.
Center Line: A visual SKShapeNode to divide the playing field.
Pause Overlay: A semi-transparent SKShapeNode that appears when the game is paused.
4. Asset & Technical Specification
Frameworks: SpriteKit, UIKit (for the gesture recognizer).
Graphics:
Pusher: Circle shape (e.g., red).
Puck: Circle shape (e.g., black).
Table: A blue rectangle with a white center line and goal creases.
(Optional) Sound Effects: Puck hit, goal scored, wall bounce.
Physics Categories (Bitmasks): This is crucial for defining interactions.
Generated swift
struct PhysicsCategory {
    static let None:        UInt32 = 0
    static let All:         UInt32 = UInt32.max
    static let Puck:        UInt32 = 0b1      // 1
    static let Pusher:      UInt32 = 0b10     // 2
    static let Wall:        UInt32 = 0b100    // 4
    static let Goal:        UInt32 = 0b1000   // 8
}
Use code with caution.
Swift
Collision/Contact Logic:
Puck collides with Pusher and Wall.
Puck has contact with Goal (it passes through but triggers an event).
Pushers do not collide with Walls or Goals.
Implementation Task Breakdown
Phase 1: Project Setup (Manual Task)
Create a New Xcode Project:
Open Xcode.
Choose File > New > Project....
Select the iOS tab and the Game template.
Product Name: AirHockey
Interface: Storyboard
Language: Swift
Game Technology: SpriteKit
Click Next and save the project.
Clean Up Template:
Open GameScene.sks and delete the "Hello, World" label.
Open GameScene.swift and delete all the code inside the GameScene class, leaving the class definition.
Open Actions.sks and GameViewController.swift for review, but no changes are needed yet.
Phase 2: Main Menu Scene (Claude Automated Task)
Task: Create the MainMenuScene.swift file. This scene should have a title and a "Start Game" label. When "Start Game" is tapped, it should transition to the GameScene.
Your Prompt to Claude:
"Create the Swift code for a SpriteKit MainMenuScene. It should display a title label 'Air Hockey' in the top half of the screen and a 'Start Game' label in the bottom half. When the 'Start Game' label is touched, it should create and present a new GameScene with a .crossFade(withDuration: 0.5) transition."
Phase 3: Game Scene & Physics World Setup (Claude Automated Task)
Task: Set up the GameScene with the background, walls, goals, and center line. Configure the physics world and define the physics categories.
Your Prompt to Claude:
"In GameScene.swift, create the basic layout for the air hockey table.
Add a didMove(to view: SKView) method.
Inside didMove, set the scene's background color to blue and set the physicsWorld.contactDelegate to self.
Define the PhysicsCategory struct as specified in the design spec.
Create a physics body that acts as a border around the entire frame to be the 'walls'. This border should have the Wall physics category.
Add two invisible rectangular nodes for the goals on the left and right edges. They should be physics bodies configured as sensors with the Goal physics category.
Draw a white line down the center of the screen to divide the playing field."
Phase 4: Game Objects (Claude Automated Task)
Task: Create functions to add the pushers and the puck to the scene.
Your Prompt to Claude:
"In GameScene.swift, create the following helper methods:
addPlayer1Pusher(): Creates a red circular SKShapeNode on the left side of the screen. It should have a physics body with the Pusher category, and its collisionBitMask should be set to only collide with the Puck.
addPlayer2Pusher(): Creates a green circular SKShapeNode on the right side of the screen with the same physics properties as player 1's pusher.
addPuck(): Creates a black circular SKShapeNode at the center of the screen. Its physics body should have the Puck category. Set its restitution to 1.0 and linearDamping to 0.1. Set its contactTestBitMask to detect contact with Goal and collisionBitMask to collide with Pusher and Wall.
Call these three methods from didMove(to view:)."
Phase 5: Player Controls (Claude Automated Task)
Task: Implement the touch-and-drag controls for both pushers, confining them to their respective halves of the screen and within the screen bounds.
Your Prompt to Claude:
"Implement the touch controls in GameScene.swift.
Add two properties to the class: var player1Pusher: SKNode? and var player2Pusher: SKNode?. Assign them in the add...Pusher methods. Also, add var activePusher: SKNode?.
Override touchesBegan(_:with:). When a touch begins, check if the touch location is inside player1Pusher or player2Pusher. If so, set that pusher as the activePusher.
Override touchesMoved(_:with:). If activePusher is not nil, update its position to the touch's new location. Add logic to prevent the pusher from crossing the center line and from going off-screen. Player 1's pusher must stay in x < self.frame.midX and Player 2's must stay in x > self.frame.midX.
Override touchesEnded(_:with:) to set activePusher to nil."
Phase 6: Pause/Resume Logic (Manual & Claude Tasks)
Add Gesture Recognizer (Manual Task):
Open GameViewController.swift.
Inside the viewDidLoad() method, after skView.presentScene(scene), add the code to create and add a UITapGestureRecognizer.
Code to add:
Generated swift
let tapGesture = UITapGestureRecognizer(target: self, action: #selector(handleTap(_:)))
tapGesture.numberOfTouchesRequired = 3
view.addGestureRecognizer(tapGesture)
Use code with caution.
Swift
Add the handleTap function to the GameViewController class. This function will call a method on the GameScene.
Generated swift
@objc func handleTap(_ sender: UITapGestureRecognizer) {
    if let scene = (view as? SKView)?.scene as? GameScene {
        scene.togglePause()
    }
}
Use code with caution.
Swift
Implement Pause Logic in GameScene (Claude Automated Task):
Your Prompt to Claude:
"In GameScene.swift, implement the pause functionality.
Add a var gameIsPaused: Bool = false property.
Create a method togglePause().
Inside togglePause(), toggle the gameIsPaused boolean. Then, set self.isPaused to the value of gameIsPaused. This will freeze all physics and actions in the scene."
Phase 7: Scoring and Reset Logic (Claude Automated Task)
Task: Implement the SKPhysicsContactDelegate to handle puck/goal contacts, update scores, and reset the puck's position.
Your Prompt to Claude:
"Make GameScene conform to SKPhysicsContactDelegate.
Add score properties: var player1Score = 0 and var player2Score = 0. Also, add SKLabelNode properties for displaying them and initialize them in didMove(to:).
Implement the didBegin(_ contact:) method.
Inside didBegin, check if the contact is between a Puck and a Goal.
If the puck hits the left goal, increment player 2's score. If it hits the right goal, increment player 1's score.
After a score, call a resetGame() method.
Create the resetGame() method. It should update the score labels on screen and then reset the puck's position to the center of the screen with zero velocity."
Phase 8: Final Integration & Polish (Manual Task)
Connect Scenes: Open GameViewController.swift. In viewDidLoad(), change let scene = GameScene(size: view.bounds.size) to let scene = MainMenuScene(size: view.bounds.size). This ensures the game starts at your new main menu.
Testing: Build and run the app on a simulator or a physical device.
Debug:
Do the pushers follow your finger correctly?
Are they constrained to their halves?
Does the puck bounce realistically?
Does the score update correctly?
Does the three-finger tap pause and unpause the game?
Does the game transition from the menu correctly?
Refine: Adjust physics properties like restitution, friction, and linearDamping to get the desired game "feel." Adjust colors and sizes as needed.
